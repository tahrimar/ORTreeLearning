AND.OR learning

Given data construct an OR tree based on some ordering

Assign weights to the edges in the OR tree - weights are relative counts of the variables in the data.

Try to find context specific independencies, conditional independencies and determinism in the data by means of exact/approximate merging of subtrees in the original tree.

		The dependencies are based on user defined ordering!
		
Generalize the OR decision tree. 

Approximate the structure of the markov network.


1. choose variables based on maximum entropy
2. build tree fully
3. stopping criteria - number of samples, uniform distribution (can be approximated)
4. test set likelihood
